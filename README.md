# Machine Learning for Data Analytics
This repository includes three case studies for the course **Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Data-Driven Decision Making** at the University of Mannheim. The case desciptions, datasets, source code, and presentation of the results are included in the respective folders. Below is a brief description of each case:

### Case 1. Descriptive Analytics for Waterjet Cutting
#### 1. Core competencies:
- Data cleasing & preparation
- Visualization of multi-dimensional dataset 
- Recognize patterns in data through visual inspection
- Provide recommendations based on the insights from data analytics

#### 2. Topic Summary
Water jet cutting is a technology for cutting a wide variety of materials using a very high- pressure jet of water. Cutting soft materials is possible using pure water jet. Adding abrasives to the water allows for cutting harder materials such as steel and concrete. Figure 1 depicts an abrasive water jet (AWJ) cutter in practice and a stylized sketch of it.

Task: AIRMINIBUS, the company that uses AWJ cutting to cut metal pieces used in aircraft, wants to improve its understanding of the AWJ machining process. 
Using the given dataset, support this effort by conducting a descriptive analytics study. The study has to identify the main drivers of the quality measures in the AWJ cutting process performed in the company. Support your answer by suitable visualizations of the provided data and quantitative statistical measures. Provide and explain ideas for future improvements of the process.


### Case 2. Unsupervised Learning for Failure Mode Detection
#### 1. Core competencies:
- Apply principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the complexity of the dataset
- Apply data clustersing techniques (e.g. K-Means) to group datapoints by the similarity of their features; thereby detect outliers, production errors, or defects
- Provide recommendations based on the insights from data analytics

#### 2. Topic Summary
Sunflower Bikes is a leading bike manufacturer in Germany. To enhance its market position in the rapidly growing European e-bike market (see Figure 1), the company wants to improve the quality of its bikes. One of the initial steps for the quality management group of the company is to better understand the current state of the production process and its output.

Over the last year, the company has gathered data for two key components of finished bikes of their flagship product the “SuperWatt” bike. The data for the first set of features is gathered after the production of the frame. The main features measured for each frame as well as their nominal values are depicted in Figure 2. Deviations from the nominal values in any direction are undesirable.

Task:

a. Use the machine learning methods to reveal the patterns hidden in the data. Explain the purpose of the methods, justify the order in which you apply the methods, and the selection of parameters used for the methods.

b. Analyze the obtained patterns quantitatively and visualize your results.

c. Discussthemanagerialimplicationsofyourfindingsandhowtheycanbeusedtoimprove the quality of the manufacturing process.

d. Create the required deliverables. Consider the guidelines in the chapter “Effective oral presentation” of the book “Trees, maps, and theorems” when creating the presentation.

### Case 3. Supervised Learning for Data Driven Tomato Yield Prediction and Control of Greenhouses
