# Machine Learning for Data Analytics
This repository includes three case studies for the course **Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Data-Driven Decision Making** at the University of Mannheim. The case desciptions, datasets, source code, and presentation of the results are included in the respective folders. Below is a brief description of each case:

### Case 1. Descriptive Analytics for Waterjet Cutting
**1. Core competencies:**
- Data cleasing & preparation
- Visualization of multi-dimensional dataset 
- Recognize patterns in data through visual inspection
- Provide recommendations based on the insights from data analytics

**2. Topic Summary**
Water jet cutting is a technology for cutting a wide variety of materials using a very high- pressure jet of water. Cutting soft materials is possible using pure water jet. Adding abrasives to the water allows for cutting harder materials such as steel and concrete. Figure 1 depicts an abrasive water jet (AWJ) cutter in practice and a stylized sketch of it.

Task: AIRMINIBUS, the company that uses AWJ cutting to cut metal pieces used in aircraft, wants to improve its understanding of the AWJ machining process. 
Using the given dataset, support this effort by conducting a descriptive analytics study. The study has to identify the main drivers of the quality measures in the AWJ cutting process performed in the company. Support your answer by suitable visualizations of the provided data and quantitative statistical measures. Provide and explain ideas for future improvements of the process.


### Case 2. Unsupervised Learning for Failure Mode Detection
**1. Core competencies:**
- Apply principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the complexity of the dataset
- Apply data clustersing techniques (e.g. K-Means) to group datapoints by the similarity of their features; thereby detect outliers, production errors, or defects
- Provide recommendations based on the insights from data analytics
